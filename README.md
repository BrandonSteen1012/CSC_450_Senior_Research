# CSC_450_Senior_Research

 ## Description

The objective of this project is to perform a comparative analysis
of two popular types of database systems, those being relational
databases and NoSQL databases. This analysis will be performed using 
MySQL and MongoDB on a dataset with varying numbers of attributes and data types

The purpose behind performing this experiment is to compare the performance of both 
systems in terms of their runtime on differing sets of data.
